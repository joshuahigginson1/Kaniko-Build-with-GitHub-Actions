# Kaniko Builds on GitHub Actions

__Updated 9th July 2024__

This directory contains a sample pipeline to push docker images to GitHub Container Registry, using Kaniko, a container tool by Google.

## What's the Problem?

[Kubernetes OWASP Top 10][5] states that DIND is 'K01' - The top cause of Kubernetes exploitation. In this example repository, we want to build a docker image inside of another docker image. This is called running 'Docker in Docker' or 'DIND'. A docker container *cannot* run it's own Docker Daemon, instead, it must hook into the parent Daemon via a UNIX socket.

Building an image using the Docker Daemon requires privileged access to it - You may have come across this before in another guise when running Docker on Linux, requiring the addition of a Docker User to the SUDOERS file.

We often build docker containers from other public images, or build docker containers with software packages taken from external sources. If a malicious attacker manages to infiltrate the supply chain of our own software's dependencies, there is a strong chance that they will target the privileged `/var/run/docker.sock` socket - It's privileged, and can do a lot of damage, from stealing intellectual property, to exploit propegation, even escaping the host system.

Madhu Akula has written an amazing series of articles explaining Kubernetes issues in detail, and I would recommend taking the time to [follow this tutorial through][4], just to see how *scary* and *straightforward* it is for a rogue package to exploit a UNIX socket misconfiguration and escape the host system to view other containers.

## What is Kaniko?

[Kaniko][3] is a tool written by Google (though not *officially* supported commercially), which utilises Linux userspace to execute each of the commands inside of a Docker container, rather than the host system itself. It is widely recommended for use on the [GitLab platform][1], but not on GitHub.

This repository utilises [Rollson's Medium Article][2] to build an example Docker Image using Kaniko on GitHub Actions, on every push to the 'main' branch.

## Installation and Usage

First, copy the .github/workflows directory, as well as it's contents, to your own repository.

Configure the two 'env' values according to the Dockerfile you would like to build:

```
env:
  IMAGE_NAME: <your-kaniko-image>  # The name of the image, to be written to GHCR as.
  DOCKERFILE_PATH: path/to/Dockerfile  # The path to your Dockerfile, in relation to the root directory of this repository.
```

After making a push to your 'main' branch, after making a change to either the Dockerfile or the GitHub workflow, a new image will build.

In the homepage of your GitHub repository, look in the right-hand menu bar for the `Releases` tab. You should see your new image.

###Â Modifying this Action

Our Docker image will only build on a push to the `main` branch. To alter this behaviour, you can edit the `on` statement. Find out more about the 'on' action reference [here.][6]

```
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - "main"
    paths:
      - "Dockerfile"
      - ".github/workflows/**"
```

## Future Improvements

- A more advanced Dockerfile example, rather than just a plain Python image.
- Use Trivy to scan our Docker Image before pushing it to GHCR with Crane.
- Use Trivy to run SAST on our Dockerfile for misconfigurations.
- Use renovatebot to detect version changes to base Docker images.
- Create both ARM and x86-64 Images.
- Incorperate Private runners with runs-on.com.
